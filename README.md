Following the tutorial on SwiftUI

There are 2 tutorials to build the Landmark App in SwiftUI:

- [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views)
- [Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation)
